# gpio-timer
A GPIO timer for DerbyNet server (https://derbynet.org/).

This project uses golang to send timer messages to the derbynet server application.  It listens for GPIO pin changes.  Use the `build.sh` script to build the executable.  Install `docker` and use `go.sh run github.com/Nescient/gpio-timer` to run the executable.  Alternatively, install `go` to build and a new enough `glibc` for running.

## Edit your GPIO Pins
The current set up is using the Libre Computer Board ROC-RK3328-CC on pins 3, 5, 11, 13 (four lanes), and pin 8 (for the gate).  See the top of [gpio.go](gpio/gpio.go) for pin constants.  The GPIOs are set to pull up and trigger on the falling edge (which is what works with the beam sensors I tested).  Our project used Adafruit IR Break Beam sensors: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2167.
